title: Social â˜­ media strikes back

I just brought back the evil back: re-opened [Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/ru.sergeev).

Here is the poll, I'd like to know if i did right.

It comes with Instagram. So I reopenned it as well. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/ru.sergeev/).

And I updated the footer with the links to the "wonderful" platforms.

I am just a little pissed off. i wanted write here a link to my poll on FB and could not. FB hides the links by all means. they want you to stay on the site, but why they would not give a link, which will become available anyway when someone comments on the post.
