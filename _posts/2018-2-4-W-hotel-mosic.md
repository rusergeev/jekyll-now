title: W - Fantastic music

I was going trough my hotel applications and found an "old friend": W Hotels Worldwide.

It is not like others. It does not sell you room nights. It plays an incredable music for you. 
The very same or alike you heard in one of the W hotels by a pool or in a looby. And you are sold.

I really like it. Check it out: [AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/w-hotels-worldwide/id435830939?mt=8).

It is not an ad from SPG nor Marriott. ;-)
